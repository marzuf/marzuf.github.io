We evaluated effectiveness of thermal passenger screening for 2019-nCoV infection at airport exit and entry to inform public health decision-making. In our baseline scenario, we estimated that 46% (95% confidence interval: 36 to 58) of infected travellers would not be detected, depending on incubation period, sensitivity of exit and entry screening, and proportion of asymptomatic cases. Airport screening is unlikely to detect a sufficient proportion of 2019-nCoV infected travellers to avoid entry of infected travellers.

The study has been published in [Eurosurveillance.](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.5.2000080)

We also created an [interactive tool](/visualisations/traveller-screening) to illustrate the effectiveness of airport screening in different scenarios.

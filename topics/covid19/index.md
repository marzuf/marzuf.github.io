Multiple members of CMMID are working on the ongoing Covid-19 (previously referred to as novel coronavirus or nCov) outbreak caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This page shows an overview of our work. We regularly update this page with new and updated work.

Our group has made multiple <a href="/visualisations" target="_blank">interactive applications</a> where some of our work can be explored further.

We also translated some of our posts in Chinese: <a style="color: #00BF6F;" title="中文版" href="zh-cn">中文版</a>
